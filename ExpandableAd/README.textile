The step-by-step instructions below go over how to use the SWF file in this code example to create an ad that is identical to the “Expandable Ads” example on the Developer Center ("http://dev.flite.com/code-examples/":http://dev.flite.com/code-examples/).
# Log into your Flite Console and create a new ad. The Make an Ad page opens, prompting you to select a template.
# Select the desired template and initialize the ad:
#* Click Blank Ad.
#* Click Custom to enter custom dimensions for the ad, and change the height to 100.
#* Click Make Ad to create a new 300x100 ad in Ad Studio.
# Configure the ad’s background:
#* In Ad Studio, click the Theme button to switch to the Theme Editor.
#* Change the Theme Style to Full Background to remove the header and footer.
#* Expand the Color setting block and change both the Border and Background settings to “a5a7a9”. This is the same shade of gray that we use in the expansion unit that corresponds to this base unit.
# Add the SWF file:
#* Click Style to switch to the Style Editor.
#* Change the Tab Style to None to remove tabs.
#* Under Content Mode (Advanced) expand the SWF setting block and select the Use API radio button.
#* Click the Choose button that appears, and upload your SWF file.

You are done! The SWF file should now appear in the preview panel. Click the ad to launch the expansion, which contains Flite’s blog, Facebook, and Twitter feeds.
