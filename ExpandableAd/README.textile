This code example creates a simple expandable ad. To see it in action, do the following:
# Log into your Flite Console and create a new ad. The *Make an Ad* page opens, prompting you to select a template.
# Select the desired template and initialize the ad:
#* Click *Blank Ad*.
#* Click *Custom* to enter custom dimensions for the ad, and change the height to 100. Leave the width at its default 300.
#* Click *Make Ad* to create a new 300x100 ad in Ad Studio.
# Configure the ad’s background:
#* In Ad Studio, click the *Theme* button to switch to the Theme Editor.
#* Change the *Theme Style* to *Full Background* to remove the header and footer.
#* Expand the *Color* setting block and change both the *Border* and *Background* settings to “a5a7a9”. This is the same shade of gray that we use in the expansion unit that corresponds to this base unit.
# Add the SWF file:
#* Click *Style* to switch to the Style Editor.
#* Change the *Tab Style* to *None* to remove tabs.
#* Under *Content Mode (Advanced)* expand the *SWF* setting block and select the *Use API* radio button.
#* Click the *Choose* button that appears, and upload the BaseUnit.swf file found in this folder.

You are done! A small banner ad for Flite should now appear in the preview panel. Click the ad to launch the expansion, which contains Flite’s blog, Twitter, and YouTube feeds.
