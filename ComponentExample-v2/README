This folder contains code examples intended to teach the user how to create a simple Flite ad component using Flash 
and Flite's Component Studio tool. The accompanying PDF document contains a detailed walkthrough of these examples.

There are three examples in this folder, each one building on the previous. Each example consists of an FLA file with 
all the Flash graphical elements, an AS file with all the AS2 code, and a compiled SWF file that can be inserted 
directly into Component Studio.

- Component-Example-1 contains the basic functionality of a "Twitter Geo Search" component that allows users to 
find tweets made on a certain topic near a particular location.
- Component-Example-2 adds some metrics tracking to this component. These metrics will show up in Flite's reporting 
engine.
- Component-Example-3 adds configuration parameters, allowing customers to change various aspects of the component's 
functionality, layout, and appearance.
